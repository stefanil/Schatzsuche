### Build Eclipse Project Files with Sources ###

cd treasurehunting
play
[treasurehunting] $ eclipse with-source=true skip-parents=false 

### Run Application for System Testing and Production ###

For development the default InMemory-DB H2 is configured with the 
conf/application.conf. Thus develop out of the box and never use
Helpers.inMemoryDB() so the tests may also be run as integration or 
system tests using PostgreSQL!

For running and testing the application in real life circumstances
(i.e. the production environment) 
use the alternative configuration file production.conf (using PostgreSQL-DB) 
by specifying the dynamic parameter config.resource like this:

Running with production conf:
play -Dconfig.resource=production.conf run

Deployment with production conf:
play -Dconfig.resource=production.conf start

Play is not supporting windows in production mode, therefore <stage> and <start> wonâ€™t work under windows.

System Testing with production.conf:
play -Dconfig.resource=production.conf test
